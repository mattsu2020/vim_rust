Uninstalling Vim

The legacy Windows-specific C utilities have been removed.  Use the Rust-based
installer instead.

To uninstall a Vim build produced from this workspace run:

    cargo run -p rust_installer -- uninstall

This command removes files created by the installer.  For installations
managed by your operating system's package manager, use that manager's
uninstall functionality.
